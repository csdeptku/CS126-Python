#This is a very simple I/O program for CS126 students. 

#Take two numbers from the user with the input function.
#The input function only returns data objects of type string.
x = input()
y = input()

#Convert a string of numbers to float.
x = float(x)  
y = float(y) 

#Compute x divided by z. 
z = x/y 

#Print the results on the screen.
print(z)
